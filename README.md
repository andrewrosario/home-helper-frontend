# DIY Helper (formerly Home Helper)
As DIY culture grows stronger and more people want to take on more and more difficult DIY projects, its going to be increasingly important to have an expert in your corner. For many of us that used to be our parents and grandparents, but with people often living farther from home, the need to ways to connect DIYers to the expertise they need has increased.

## Getting Started
DIY helper is available online now at https://diyhelper.herokuapp.com/. I encourage you to check it out. You many either create your own account or use our test account with the login 'lizzo@lizzo.com' and the password 'lizzo' (of course she's also an amazing DIYer, why would she stop at music). Feel free to poke around a bit. The test account has access to the expert dashboard, so please try out both sides of the experience.

The backend code is available at https://github.com/andrewrosario/home-helper-backend. We use RESTful conventions for routes and get requests to https://homehelper.herokuapp.com/projects/1 (1 may be subsituted for any number as long as that project exisits) are open so you can get a taste of the API.

## Sign Up
